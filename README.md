# Eco-Friendly-Portable-Cooling-System
Our project aims to solve two of the major problems faced by general community, first is the lack of cheap and affordable air conditioning systems, and the other is of getting purified air. The basic idea is based on the working of Thermoelectric coupler modules (TEC1-127xx) in which we use the physics of atoms, that an applied temperature gradient causes charge carriers in the material to diffuse from the hot side to the cold side which in turn produces a potential difference across the two sides and vice versa. This temperature difference is utilized to cool the environment. We increased the efficiency of our model by minimizing the temperature of the hotter side, which was quite a challenging task, so we applied external eco-friendly cooling technique using water circulation through an earthen pot as well as, a normal fan in order to get the cooling system at the cheapest possible cost.
